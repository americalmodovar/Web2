    <h5>Your body was designed to be well and heal itself, learn why <br> this isn't happening and how to safeguard your body from disease. 
    </h5>
    <p><br><br>We believe — and medical studies prove — that thebest way to lose weight and keep it off is to simply  <br> keep track of the foods you eat. Gimmicky machines and fad diets don't work, so we designed a free website <br> and mobile apps that make calorie counting and food tracking easy.
    </p>
    <p>We focus on not only getting you to lose weight, but helping you keep it off. In fact, our greatest success stories <br> come from helping people maintain their weight loss management for years. Losing weight is so much more than changing <br> what you eat. It’s understanding how the body reacts to certain foods. It’s understanding how certain behaviors and habits <br>develop that lead us to eat. Our nutrition counseling center will give you the means and the tools to maintain that control!.
