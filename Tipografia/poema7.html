		<p>What did fine French Cinder elles wear besides<br> glass, what high class did they hope to flaunt to</p>
		<h3>the ball, what gall muster towards, I do?</h3><br>
<h4>
Did they eat ash, secret, pretend inside, ache for privileges to take <br>
midnight steed ride—to prince, to price, to prove flamed thoughts, <br>
undo braided tresses, guesses; did they have clues about the way <br>
ever-after collides in fives, in tens, muttered end lines tight shut, <br>
a fight to rise between odd hours ticking, tripping like a da-dum <br>
tapped short, slight cut into small rooms, I am’s that jam, turning <br>
coated slippers toward spondee minutes spent as splintered moments <br>
on silk shorn string?</h4><br>
