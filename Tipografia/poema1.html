<p>"Pity the poor step-sister those big feet she’ll never stuff <br> in a size-six sonnet, her flesh so fulsome the slipper <br> seems effete, unworthy of the labor spent on it."<br><br>

<p>"But try she must, and so she makes a pass,
jams four fat toes in the narrow throat,
the fifth pig smarting, pressed against the glass
though pain’s no stranger—she knows it by rote."</p>

		<p>"The other shoe drops—as it is wont to do—
a second foot is squeezed into the vamp. She stands up straight and takes a stride towards you."<br><br>

"Her footfall heavy as a farmgirl’s tramp. The slipper strains against those excess feet. She hobbles onward—she has a prince to meet."    —Angela Alaimo O’Donnell</p>
