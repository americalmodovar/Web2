		<p>She had the day to wander so she strolled the forest edge, heard<br>
        the mirth of fairies long at play, saw a rope-swing gaily swaying</p>
		<h3>on a limb, inviting her to step into the woods</h3>
		<p>and ask, Can I come? Can I play?</p><br>
		<p>They taught her fairy tales and sang hand-clapping games down<br>
        by the brook—but morning-glory petals started folding—day was <br>
        closing, evening coming and with heavy steps she had to turn away.<br> 
        I cannot play. I cannot play.</p><br>
