		<h1><span>What the Shadows Made</span> </h1>

		<h3>Here in the library of the trees, a lounge,<br>
a quick plot of grasses—but for some cut<br>
and a tongue of May Apples, an opening,<br>
like a surprised mouth in the face of day.<br>
</h3>
<h4>I am past the thickets of human definition<br>
that rise from the soft ground around me,<br>
like pencils, whose green ends pitch and swing<br>
in the wind as they write what happens next.</h4>

<p>A slender iridescence in the air appears,<br>
like a hyphen between worlds, watching me<br>
with limped eyes from a single blade of grass,<br>
its wings shaped from the forgotten shadows<br> of noon.<br><br>

Now it is written in the trees from which it arrived,<br>
a prince or princess in disguise, a fairy<br>
on its way to a story meant for bedtime,<br>
forever small and bright in lovely dreams.</p>
<h3>—Richard Maxson</h3>
